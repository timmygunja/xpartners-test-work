# What is this template?

This template allows you to quick-start your Fullstack application using the MERN stack, it has a server setup with some basic authentication, and a client ready to communicate with the backend.<br />
I have attempted to use the best practices for both ends, which should make it easy for any advanced/new developer to use, and perhaps learn from.

### To run the client and/or the server, you can do any of the following:

From the `root` of your project run:

> npm start

#### OR

Open terminal #1 (backend)

> cd ./server<br />
> npm start

Open terminal #2 (frontend)

> cd ./client<br />
> npm start
